### Le Vu Minh Huy | Ted

I'm trying to be an any-stack developer, which means I'd love to explore new stacks, languages, ... in order to build more awesome, performant project.

I'm using Arch linux btw, with Awesomewm; coding JS, Rust in Neovim; typing on an 65% keyboard and working remotely in my tiny cozy room.
